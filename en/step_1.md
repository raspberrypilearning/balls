## You will make

Balls! is the final project in the [More Unity](){target:"_blank"} path. 

You are going to create an interactive 3D experience using Unitys physics and and a range of materials. Your project could be a a game, a digital interactive toy or marble run, or a sensory or art experience. ... 

Your creation will need to meet the **project brief**.

Create an interactive project that showcases a range of marble/ball materials. It could be a game, a digital interactive toy or marble run, or a sensory or art experience. 

This project is brought to you with generous support from [Unity Technologies](https://unity.com/){:target="_blank"}.  These [projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/unity-intro){:target="_blank"} offer young people the opportunity to take their first steps in creating virtual worlds using Real-Time 3D.

A <span style="color: #0faeb0">project brief</span> describes what a project must do. It's a bit like being given a mission to complete.
</p>

You will:
+ Use your Unity skills to create an interactive experience
+ Combine Rigidbodies, Colliders and Physics Materials to change the way 3D GameObjects behave when they collide
+ Use code to change the Materials of the GameObjects in your 3D experience
+ Share your projects with others so they can try it out and you can get feedback

### Play ▶️

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1">

Click on the embedded project and... <mark>Add in objective of the example</mark>

Think about the physics and the materials used. 
+ How have Physics Materials been used to change the way objects collide?
+ What different Materials have been used and how do they change as you play?

### PROJECT BRIEF: Balls!
<hr style="border-top: 2px solid black;">

Create an interactive marble/ball project that showcases a range of materials and physics interactions.

Your project should:
+ Use a ball with a Rigidbody that rolls around a level and collides with obstacles
+ Have a range of materials to give the project a defined look and feel
+ Give the user a goal to complete.

Your project could:
+ Use the keyboard to control the ball itself
+ Use the keyboard to tilt the world and roll the ball
+ Use scripts to change materials on collisions
+ Have sound effects and music
