## You will make

Marble Mayhem! is the final project in the [More Unity](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/more-unity){:target="_blank"} path. 

You are going to create an interactive 3D experience using Unity's physics and a range of materials. Your project could be a a game, a digital interactive toy, a marble run, or a sensory or art experience.

This project is brought to you with generous support from [Unity Technologies](https://unity.com/){:target="_blank"}.  These [projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/unity-intro){:target="_blank"} offer young people the opportunity to take their first steps in creating virtual worlds using Real-Time 3D.

Your creation will need to meet the **project brief**.

You will:
+ Use your Unity skills to create an interactive experience
+ Combine Rigidbodies, Colliders and Physics Materials to change the way 3D GameObjects behave when they collide
+ Use code to change the Materials of the GameObjects in your 3D experience
+ Share your project with others so they can try it out and you can get feedback

### Play ▶️

--- task ---

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1">

Click on the embedded project and use the <kbd>WASD</kbd> keys to roll the ball down the ramp. Try to change the material of every floor tile by rolling around on it.

Think about the physics and the materials used. 
+ How have Physics Materials been used to change the way objects collide?
+ Which different Materials have been used and how do they change as you play?

### PROJECT BRIEF: Marble Mayhem!
<hr style="border-top: 2px solid black;">

Create an interactive marble project that showcases a range of materials and physics interactions.

Your project should:
+ Use a Sphere with a Rigidbody that rolls around a level and collides with obstacles
+ Have a range of materials to give the project a defined look and feel
+ Give the user a goal to complete.

Your project could:
+ Use the keyboard to control the ball itself
+ Use the keyboard to tilt the world and roll the ball
+ Use scripts to change materials on collisions
+ Have sound effects and music

### Get inspiration

--- task ---

Think about the ways these experiences use physics and materials as you investigate to get more ideas:
