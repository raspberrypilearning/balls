## Upgrade your project

If you have time, you can upgrade your project. You might already have ideas about what else to add or you might want to go back to the first step and look at other projects for more inspiration.

You could:
- Add more levels, obstacles, sound effects, material changes for the player to discover
- Add clear instructions such as a start screen so they player knows what to do
- Improve the scenery, sound, and particle effects to create the right atmosphere for your adventure 
- Observe others playing your 3D adventure then make adjustments or improvements

Take a look at some Marble Mayhem! projects created by community members in the Raspberry Pi Foundationâ€™s gallery of [3D adventure Community Projects](https://wke.lt/w/s/DS1fHk){:target="_blank"}.
