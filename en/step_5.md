## Upgrade your project

If you have time, you can upgrade your project. You might already have ideas about what else to add or you might want to go back to the first step and look at other projects for more inspiration.

You could:
- Add more levels, obstacles, sound effects, material changes for the player to discover
- Add clear instructions such as a start screen so they player knows what to do
- Create your own particle effects to add extra style to your project 
- Observe others playing your marble game then make adjustments or improvements
