## Your idea

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
You can build on any of your previous Design or Explore projects, or if you have enough time you can start a completely new project. 

Use this step to plan your project. You can plan by just thinking, tinkering, drawing, or writing, or however you like!

### What are you making?

--- task ---

What type of project are you going to create? Is the goal to challenge the player or to show them a beautiful world they can play around in?

It could be:
- A game with obstacles and a defined goal
- An art piece, allowing the player to explore the world you have created
- A playground for players to experience the physics inside of Unity

--- /task ---

### Who is it for?

--- task ---

Think about who you will make your project for (your **audience**).

- Do they play lots of games already?
- What would they be looking for in a game or art piece?
- How will you make them want to explore the project you have created?

### Game design or experience design

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">"Games, when you play them with other people, â€¦ actually strengthen the reward circuitry so it actually makes people more social and more likely to collaborate because their brains are actually more responsive to people online and offline. Games are transforming the brains of people who play them in largely positive ways." Jane Mcgonigal, Director of game research and development for the Institite for the Future</p>

![](INSERT BANNER OF EXAMPLES)

Think about the skills you have gained in this pathway and how you will use them to create your project:
- What will your level look like, will it be a track, a tiled floor or a combination of the two?
- How will the player control the ball, directly or by tilting the world?
- Will there be more than one player? Which keys will you use for them?
- What obstacles will you put in your player's path? Will they spin? Move up and down?
- Will you use Physics materials to change the way the ball bounces off certain objects?
- Can you use the scripts you have created during this path?
- Is there an end to your project? If so, how will the player know they have reached it?
